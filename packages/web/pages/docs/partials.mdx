# Partials

Handlebar partials are a powerful feature of the Handlebars templating language, enabling the creation of reusable code snippets or templates. They provide a convenient way to define and include smaller, modular chunks of code within larger Handlebars templates, enhancing code organization and reusability.

Phake takes advantage of this system by leveraging a file naming convention. By following the convention of naming files as `[name].partial.hbs`, Phake automatically recognizes these files as reusable code and allows them to be referenced in other templates simply by their name.

This approach streamlines the development process by encouraging the creation of reusable partials and making them easily accessible for incorporation into various templates. By adopting this convention, developers can efficiently build and maintain consistent and modular code structures, ultimately enhancing productivity and code maintainability.

## Example

Create a partial template named `user.partial.hbs`. `Phake` will register this partial as `user`

```json showLineNumbers filename="user.partial.hbs"
{
    "userName": "{{faker 'string.alpha' 10}}",
    "displayName": "{{faker 'person.firstName'}}",
    "dateOfBirth": "{{faker 'date.birthdate' min=18 max=65 mode='age'}}"
}
```

The `user` partial can then be referenced in another partial as follows

```json showLineNumbers filename="users.json.hbs"
[
    {{#repeat 5}}
        {{> user}}
    {{/repeat}}
]
```
